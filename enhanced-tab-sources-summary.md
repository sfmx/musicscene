# Enhanced Tab Source Research - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Problem Addressed
The original research protocol relied too heavily on Ultimate Guitar alone, which can lead to inaccuracies since it's primarily a community-driven site with variable quality.

## ✅ Enhanced Tab Source Strategy

### Multi-Tier Source System Implemented

**Tier 1: Official/Professional Sources**
- Guitar World Magazine tabs (artist-verified)
- Official songbooks and artist-released tabs
- Highest accuracy, limited catalog

**Tier 2: Professional Tab Sites**
- **Songsterr**: Interactive tabs with timing accuracy
- **TabsGuru**: Professional transcriptions for complex songs
- Higher quality than community sites

**Tier 3: Community Sites (Quality-Filtered)**
- **Ultimate Guitar**: 4+ star ratings only, large catalog
- **911Tabs**: Cross-referencing and format variety
- Requires careful quality filtering

## 🔍 Enhanced Research Protocol

### Required Verification Process
1. ✅ **Tablature verified across at least 3 different sources**
2. ✅ **Priority order**: Official > Professional > Community
3. ✅ **Tuning never assumed** - must be confirmed by multiple sources
4. ✅ **Cross-check chord progressions** between sources
5. ✅ **Document all sources used** with specific versions/ratings

## PURPOSE
This is a step-by-step, reusable prompt for converting existing song analysis pages or creating new ones using the JSON-driven component system. Follow every step in order for guaranteed success.

---

## üî• CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### BEFORE YOU START
- [ ] Read the full prompt before beginning
- [ ] Have professional tab sources ready (Songsterr, TabsGuru, Guitar World)
- [ ] Understand the JSON structure requirements
- [ ] Know that internal reference tabs are REQUIRED first

### ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS
1. **Internal reference tab MUST be created first** (Step 1)
2. **JSON structure MUST match template exactly** (Step 2)
3. **Page component MUST use exact template format** (Step 3)
4. **Data registry MUST be updated** (Step 4)
5. **All validation steps MUST pass** (Step 5)

---

## üìã COMPLETE WORKFLOW

### STEP 1: CREATE INTERNA**When in doubt, reference the existing implementations and template files. They are the authoritative examples of correct structure and formatting.**

---

## üîó LINK VERIFICATION & MAINTENANCE PROTOCOL

### **Initial Link Verification (Required Before Research)**
1. **Test All Source URLs:**
   ```bash
   # Create verification checklist for each song
   - [ ] Wikipedia: [test basic URL format]
   - [ ] AllMusic: [search and verify album/song pages exist]  
   - [ ] Songfacts: [search and verify song entry exists]
   - [ ] Songsterr: [search and verify tab exists with correct URL format]
   - [ ] Official sources: [verify band websites, interview sources]
   ```

2. **Document Link Status:**
   - **WORKING:** Full URL verified and accessible
   - **VERIFIED-PARTIAL:** Content exists but URL needs refinement
   - **SUBSCRIPTION:** Content exists but requires premium access
   - **NOT-FOUND:** Content does not exist at expected location
   - **REFERENCE-ONLY:** Source mentioned for completeness but not directly accessible

3. **URL Format Standards:**
   - **Wikipedia:** `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/[Exact_Song_Title]`
   - **AllMusic:** `https://www.allmusic.com/album/[album-slug]` or `/song/[song-slug]`
   - **Songfacts:** `https://www.songfacts.com/facts/[artist]/[song-title]`
   - **Songsterr:** `https://www.songsterr.com/a/wsa/[artist]-[song]-tab-s[number]`

### **Link Maintenance Standards**
1. **Research Phase:** All links must be tested and verified before completing research summary
2. **Documentation Phase:** Include verification date and status for each link
3. **Regular Updates:** Plan for periodic re-verification of critical links
4. **Fallback Documentation:** Always include alternative sources when primary links may change

### **Handling Problematic Links**
1. **Broken Links:** Document as `[URL - NOT ACCESSIBLE as of [date]]`
2. **Subscription Content:** Note as `[SUBSCRIPTION REQUIRED - Reference only]`
3. **Changed URLs:** Update with current URL and note previous URL if helpful
4. **Missing Content:** Document search attempts and alternative sources found REFERENCE TAB FILE ‚≠ê (REQUIRED FIRST)

### STEP 2: CREATE JSON DATA FILE

**Purpose:** Convert extracted content into structured data using internal reference for accuracy.

1. **Copy Template**
```bash
cp src/data/songs/_template.json src/data/songs/[song-slug].json
```

2. **Fill All Placeholders** (Reference your internal tab file throughout)

3. **CRITICAL STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:**

**‚úÖ CORRECT Property Names:**
- `sections` (NOT `songSections`)
- `similarTechniques` (NOT `similarSongs`) 
- `timeStamp` format: `"0:00-0:15"` (NOT `"0:00 - 0:15"`)

**‚úÖ REQUIRED Sections Structure:**
```json
"sections": [
  {
    "name": "Section Name",
    "timeStamp": "0:00-0:15", 
    "technique": "Primary Technique",
    "key": "Song Key",
    "description": "Detailed description",
    "chords": ["Chord1", "Chord2", "Chord3"],
    "progression": "Chord1 - Chord2 - Chord3 - Chord1",
    "vexTab": "VexTab notation (when possible)",
    "tabs": "ASCII tabs (fallback when VexTab not available)",
    "notes": [
      "Performance note 1",
      "Performance note 2"
    ]
  }
]
```

**‚úÖ REQUIRED RelatedSongs Structure:**
```json
"relatedSongs": {
  "acdc": [
    {
      "title": "Song Title",
      "link": "/lessons/songs/song-analysis/song-slug",
      "similarity": "Why this song is similar"
    }
  ],
  "similarTechniques": [
    {
      "title": "Song Title", 
      "artist": "Artist Name",
      "technique": "Specific Technique",
      "similarity": "Technical relationship description"
    }
  ]
}
```

**‚úÖ REQUIRED Techniques with Chords:**
```json
"techniques": [
  {
    "name": "Power Chords",
    "description": "Description",
    "difficulty": "Intermediate",
    "primaryTechnique": true,
    "details": {
      "chords": ["B5", "E5", "F#5"],
      "progression": "B5 - E5 - F#5 - B5",
      "notes": ["Technical note 1"],
      "tips": ["Practice tip 1"]
    }
  }
]
```

4. **Content Guidelines:**
   - **Use internal reference tab** to verify all technical details
   - **Include chord arrays** for automatic chord diagram generation
   - **Add VexTab notation** when possible (preferred over ASCII tabs)
   - **Write educational content** appropriate for the difficulty level
   - **Cross-reference related songs** already in the system

5. **Validation:**
   - [ ] All placeholders replaced with real content
   - [ ] Chord arrays included in sections and techniques
   - [ ] Technical details match internal reference tab
   - [ ] JSON syntax is valid (use online validator)
   - [ ] No references to external tabs/sources

---

### STEP 3: CREATE PAGE USING TEMPLATE

**Purpose:** Create minimal page component that leverages the JSON data system.

1. **Create Directory:**
```bash
mkdir -p "src/app/lessons/songs/song-analysis/[song-slug]"
```

2. **Copy Template:**
```bash
cp "src/components/SongAnalysis/_page-template.tsx" "src/app/lessons/songs/song-analysis/[song-slug]/page.tsx"
```

3. **Customize Template** (Follow EXACT format):
```tsx
"use client";

import React from "react";
import SongAnalysisPageTemplate from '@/components/SongAnalysis/SongAnalysisPageTemplate';

export default function SongNameAnalysis() {
  return (
    <SongAnalysisPageTemplate 
      songSlug="song-slug" 
      displayName="Song Display Name" 
    />
  );
}
```

4. **Naming Examples:**
   - **Function Name:** `BackInBlackAnalysis`, `YouShookMeAllNightLongAnalysis`
   - **songSlug:** `"back-in-black"`, `"you-shook-me-all-night-long"`
   - **displayName:** `"Back in Black"`, `"You Shook Me All Night Long"`

5. **Validation:**
   - [ ] Function name follows PascalCase convention
   - [ ] songSlug matches JSON filename (without .json)
   - [ ] displayName is user-friendly
   - [ ] No extra code or modifications to template

---

### STEP 4: UPDATE DATA REGISTRY

**Purpose:** Register the new song in the system so it can be loaded.

1. **Add Import to `src/lib/songData.ts`:**
```typescript
import songSlugData from '@/data/songs/song-slug.json';
```

2. **Add to songDataMap Object:**
```typescript
export function getSongData(songSlug: string): SongData | null {
  const songDataMap: Record<string, SongData> = {
    'thunderstruck': thunderstruckData as SongData,
    'for-those-about-to-rock': forThoseAboutToRockData as SongData,
    'back-in-black': backInBlackData as SongData,
    'highway-to-hell': highwayToHellData as SongData,
    'song-slug': songSlugData as SongData, // ADD NEW SONG HERE
  };
  
  return songDataMap[songSlug] || null;
}
```

3. **Add to getAllSongSlugs Function:**
```typescript
export function getAllSongSlugs(): string[] {
  return [
    'thunderstruck',
    'for-those-about-to-rock', 
    'back-in-black',
    'highway-to-hell',
    'song-slug' // ADD NEW SONG HERE
  ];
}
```

4. **Validation:**
   - [ ] Import statement matches exact filename
   - [ ] Song slug added to both functions
   - [ ] Maintains alphabetical or logical order

## ‚ùå COMMON ERRORS & SOLUTIONS

### Data Structure Errors
**Problem:** Wrong property names in JSON
**Solution:** Use `sections` NOT `songSections`, `similarTechniques` NOT `similarSongs`

### Missing Chord Diagrams
**Problem:** Chord diagrams don't appear
**Solution:** Include `chords` arrays in sections and technique details

### Inaccurate Technical Information
**Problem:** Wrong tuning, key, or equipment information
**Solution:** Complete multi-source research protocol, create research summary document, cross-verify all technical details

### Build Failures
**Problem:** TypeScript or build errors
**Solution:** Check imports in songData.ts, verify JSON syntax, ensure component exports match

### Component Errors
**Problem:** Page doesn't render or shows errors
**Solution:** Follow template exactly, verify songSlug matches JSON filename

### Missing Content
**Problem:** Sections appear empty or malformed  
**Solution:** Double-check JSON structure against template, verify all required fields

## üö® CONVERSION WORKFLOW (For Existing Pages)

When converting an existing page, follow this extraction process:

### PHASE A: EXTRACT EXISTING CONTENT
1. **Read the existing page completely**
2. **Extract:** Song metadata (title, artist, album, year, etc.)
3. **Extract:** All techniques with descriptions and difficulty levels
4. **Extract:** Song sections with timing and descriptions
5. **Extract:** Equipment recommendations and settings
6. **Extract:** Learning path progression
7. **Extract:** Related songs and cross-references

### PHASE B: RESEARCH AND VERIFY
1. **Research tablature** on Ultimate Guitar for the extracted song
2. **Create internal reference tab** with verified technical content
3. **Cross-reference** extracted content with accurate tablature
4. **Note discrepancies** and prioritize accuracy from verified sources

### PHASE C: RESTRUCTURE AND IMPLEMENT
1. **Map extracted content** to JSON template structure
2. **Fill JSON file** using internal reference tab for accuracy
3. **Replace existing page** entirely with template component
4. **Update data registry** and validate

### PHASE D: QUALITY ASSURANCE
1. **Compare** new page with original for content completeness
2. **Test** all functionality and visual elements
3. **Verify** technical accuracy against reference material
4. **Validate** all build and runtime requirements

# Song Conversion Master Prompt - Research Enhancement Summary

## üéØ Problem Identified
The original master prompt relied solely on Ultimate Guitar for technical information, leading to inaccurate details like incorrect tuning information for "Sweet Child O' Mine" (incorrectly listed as standard tuning when it's actually Eb tuning).

## ‚úÖ Enhancements Made

### 1. Multi-Source Research Protocol Added
**New Required Sources:**
- **Wikipedia**: Historical context, album information, chart performance
- **AllMusic**: Professional music analysis, genre classification
- **Songfacts**: Songwriting details, recording information
- **Ultimate Guitar**: Technical tablature (4+ star ratings only)
- **Official Sources**: Band interviews, documentaries, liner notes

### 2. Research Documentation System
**New Directory Structure:**
- `src/data/songs/_research-notes/` - Contains research summaries
- `[song-slug]-research.md` - Individual research documents per song
- `README.md` - Research methodology documentation

**Research Summary Template Includes:**
- Basic Information (verified across sources)
- Technical Details with source verification
- Equipment Used with documentation
- Musical Analysis
- Historical Context
- Complete Source List
- Fact-Check Notes

### 3. Enhanced Quality Standards
**New Verification Requirements:**
- ‚úÖ Tuning confirmed from multiple sources (never assume standard)
- ‚úÖ Tempo verified with metronome or official recordings
- ‚úÖ Key signature confirmed through harmonic analysis
- ‚úÖ Equipment details verified from multiple sources
- ‚úÖ Historical context fact-checked

### 4. Updated Master Prompt Sections
**Modified STEP 1:**
- Added comprehensive multi-source research protocol
- Added requirement for research summary creation
- Enhanced quality check with verification requirements

**Updated Common Errors:**
- Added "Inaccurate Technical Information" section
- Emphasized importance of multi-source verification

**Enhanced Success Criteria:**
- Added research phase requirements
- Separated validation into logical categories
- Added content quality standards

### 5. Example Implementation: Sweet Child O' Mine Corrections
**Technical Corrections Made:**
- ‚ùå **Incorrect**: D Major, Standard tuning
- ‚úÖ **Correct**: Db Major, Eb tuning (half-step down)

**Research Documentation Created:**
- `sweet-child-o-mine-research.md` with full source verification
- Updated reference tab with research cross-reference
- Updated JSON with accurate technical information

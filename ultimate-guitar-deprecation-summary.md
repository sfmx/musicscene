# Ultimate Guitar Deprecation Summary

## Decision Made: Ultimate Guitar Moved to Fallback Status

Based on extensive quality analysis and comparison with professional sources, Ultimate Guitar has been moved from a primary verification source to a fallback-only source in our research protocol.

## Reasons for Change

### Quality Issues Identified
1. **Inconsistent Accuracy**: High variability in tab quality, even among highly-rated submissions
2. **Community-Driven Errors**: Perpetuation of common mistakes across multiple versions
3. **Lack of Professional Oversight**: No editorial verification process for submissions
4. **Tuning Issues**: Frequent assumptions about standard tuning without verification
5. **Equipment Misinformation**: Often lacks or contains incorrect equipment details

### Superior Alternatives Available
1. **Guitar World**: Professional magazine transcriptions with artist verification
2. **Songsterr**: Interactive tabs with accurate timing and professional oversight
3. **TabsGuru**: High-quality professional transcriptions with detailed arrangements
4. **911Tabs**: Useful aggregation tool for finding multiple source cross-references

## New Research Protocol

### Priority Order (Revised)
1. **Tier 1**: Guitar World / Official Sources
2. **Tier 2**: Songsterr, TabsGuru
3. **Tier 3**: 911Tabs (aggregation/cross-reference)
4. **Tier 4**: Ultimate Guitar (fallback only)

### Ultimate Guitar Usage Rules (When Used)
- **ONLY** when higher-tier sources are unavailable
- **REQUIRE** 4+ stars AND 100+ votes minimum
- **MUST** cross-verify with at least 2 other sources
- **NEVER** use as sole source for critical details (tuning, equipment, etc.)
- **DOCUMENT** clearly when used as fallback in research notes

## Files Updated
1. `docs/song-conversion-master-prompt.md` - Research protocol updated
2. `guitar-tab-sources-guide.md` - Source rankings and recommendations revised
3. This summary document created for reference

## Impact on Existing Research
- All existing song research summaries remain valid
- Future conversions will follow new protocol
- When updating existing songs, apply new verification standards

## Quality Benefits Expected
1. More accurate technical details (tuning, tempo, key)
2. Better equipment information verification
3. Reduced propagation of common tab errors
4. Higher confidence in musical analysis accuracy
5. Professional-grade source reliability

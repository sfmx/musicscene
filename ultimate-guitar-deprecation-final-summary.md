  - Revised research summary template to de-emphasize Ultimate Guitar

#### 2. Guitar Tab Sources Guide (`guitar-tab-sources-guide.md`)

- **Changes**:
  - Downgraded accuracy rating from 3 stars to 2 stars
  - Updated usage recommendations to emphasize other sources first
  - Added warnings about quality variability
  - Revised use case guidelines to minimize Ultimate Guitar reliance

### New Source Priority Order

#### Primary Sources (Use First)

2. **Songsterr** - Interactive tabs with professional oversight
3. **TabsGuru** - High-quality professional transcriptions

#### Secondary Sources (Cross-Reference)
4. **911Tabs** - Aggregation tool for finding multiple sources

#### Fallback Sources (Last Resort Only)
5. **Ultimate Guitar** - Use ONLY when other sources unavailable
   - **Requirements**: 4+ stars AND 100+ votes minimum
   - **Must**: Cross-verify with at least 2 other sources
   - **Never**: Use as sole source for critical details
   - **Document**: Clearly note when used as fallback

### Impact on Research Quality

#### Expected Improvements
1. **More Accurate Technical Details**: Tuning, tempo, key verification from professional sources
2. **Better Equipment Information**: Verified from official and professional sources
3. **Reduced Error Propagation**: Less reliance on community-driven mistakes
4. **Higher Confidence**: Professional-grade source reliability
5. **Consistent Quality**: Standardized approach to source verification

#### Backward Compatibility
- All existing song research summaries remain valid
- Existing reference tabs don't need immediate updates
- New conversions will follow updated protocol
- Future updates can apply new standards when convenient

### Verification Completed
- ✅ All documentation files updated
- ✅ Source priorities reordered correctly
- ✅ Usage rules clearly defined

### Next Steps
1. Apply new protocol to future song conversions
2. Consider updating existing songs during routine maintenance
3. Monitor quality improvements with new verification standards
4. Document any additional high-quality sources discovered

2025/07/31: I've introduced a json schema definition file #file:song-analysis.schema.json as the song-analysis pages we currently have a mixed implementation of trying to use components, inconsistent content in song-analysis pages and we are also moving away from vextab and using alphatab instead. I've added an instructions file #file:song-anlaysis.md as a starting point to refine the generation, update, and syncronization of song-analysis pages. We need to clearly define a verifiable step based process in the instructions file based on our existing information in the docs directory #file:song-analysis-system.md and other docs files associated with the song-analysis pages. Please help me define the song-analysis step based process instructions process further. We need to clearly define the steps catering for the case where the pages exist and for new additions. Don't write any code just yet. I want to focus on the process first. I've also added a starter file for #file:development-guidelines.md which I would like to build up over time.
2025/07/31: Lets work through the steps 1 by 1 and iterate and refine them as we progress, write the proposed steps we have to the #file:song-anlaysis.md instructions file as a starting point. Then as the first step in the refinement process, define a prompt to be used to drive the process in the first place which should be added to the top of the #file:song-anlaysis.md instructions file. This prompt will be used to drive the process after we've clearly defined all of the steps. Then we need to define the purpose of the song analysis pages and what information should displayed on song-analysis pages to make them valuable to budding guitarists and professional musicians alike. Once that is defined we need to look at the research process and definition and artefacts generated i.e. json data files. _reference-tabs and _research_notes

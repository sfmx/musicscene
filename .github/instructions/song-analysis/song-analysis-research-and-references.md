# Song Analysis Research and Reference Creation Guide

## Overview

This guide provides the complete methodology for researching and creating reference materials for song analysis pages. This is **Step B1** in the song analysis creation process and must be completed before any JSON data creation or page development.

## Research Methodology

### Phase 1: Multi-Source Research Protocol

#### **A. Technical/Tablature Sources (Priority Order)**

**‚≠ê PRIMARY SOURCES (Use First):**

1. **Guitar World/Revolver Magazine Tabs**
   - Official magazine transcriptions
   - Based on interviews with original artists
   - Usually available in magazine archives or special issues
   - **Search Strategy**: `"[song title]" "[artist]" site:guitarworld.com tab OR tablature`
   - **Verification**: Look for official artist quotes or session musician credits

2. **Songsterr** - `https://www.songsterr.com/a/wa/search?pattern=[song]+[artist]`
   - Interactive tabs with accurate timing
   - Multi-instrument arrangements
   - Professional transcriptions with playback verification
   - **Quality Check**: Look for high vote counts and recent updates
   - **Format**: Provides tempo, timing, and multi-track arrangements

3. **TabsGuru** - `https://tabsguru.com/search/?q=[song]+[artist]`
   - High-quality professional transcriptions
   - Often includes official tabs when available
   - Good for complex songs and solos
   - **Quality Check**: Verify source attribution and transcriber credentials

**üìä SECONDARY SOURCES (Cross-Reference):**

4. **911Tabs** - `https://www.911tabs.com/search.php?search=[song]+[artist]`
   - Aggregates tabs from multiple sources
   - Good for cross-referencing different versions
   - Includes power tabs and guitar pro files
   - **Use For**: Finding alternative interpretations and additional sources

**‚ö†Ô∏è FALLBACK ONLY (Last Resort):**

5. **Ultimate Guitar** - `https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/search.php?title=[song]+[artist]`
   - **Use ONLY** when primary sources unavailable
   - **Requirements**: 4+ star ratings AND 100+ votes minimum
   - **Must cross-verify** with at least 2 other sources
   - **Quality varies significantly** - use with extreme caution

#### **B. Historical/Contextual Sources**

**Song Information & Context:**
- **Wikipedia**: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/[Song_Title]`
  - Album information, release dates, chart positions
  - Recording details, personnel, equipment used
  - Cultural context and musical significance

- **AllMusic**: `https://www.allmusic.com/search/songs/[song]+[artist]`
  - Professional music analysis and reviews
  - Genre classification and influences
  - Technical performance details

- **Songfacts**: `https://www.songfacts.com/search?q=[song]+[artist]`
  - Songwriting credits and inspiration
  - Recording session details
  - Equipment and production information

**Official Band Sources:**
- Band websites, interviews, documentaries
- Direct quotes about techniques and equipment
- Original intentions and creative process
- Equipment specifications from gear interviews

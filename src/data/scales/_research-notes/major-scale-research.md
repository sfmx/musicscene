## Basic Information
- **Scale Name:** Major Scale
- **Scale Type:** Heptatonic (7-note scale)
- **Mode:** Ionian mode (1st mode of the major scale)
- **Interval Pattern:** W-W-H-W-W-W-H (Whole-Whole-Half-Whole-Whole-Whole-Half)
- **Character:** Bright, happy, uplifting, optimistic, stable

## Technical Details (VERIFIED)
- **Intervals from Root:** 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6 - 7 - 8
- **Scale Degrees:** Root, Major 2nd, Major 3rd, Perfect 4th, Perfect 5th, Major 6th, Major 7th, Octave
- **Relative Minor:** Located a minor 3rd (3 semitones) below the major root
- **Parallel Minor:** Same root note but with lowered 3rd, 6th, and 7th degrees

## Key Examples and Applications
- **C Major (No Sharps/Flats):** C - D - E - F - G - A - B - C
- **G Major (1 Sharp):** G - A - B - C - D - E - F# - G
- **F Major (1 Flat):** F - G - A - Bb - C - D - E - F
- **D Major (2 Sharps):** D - E - F# - G - A - B - C# - D

## Guitar Fretboard Patterns
### Pattern 1 (Open Position - C Major)
- Low E: 3rd fret (G), 5th fret (A), 7th fret (B)
- A: 2nd fret (B), 3rd fret (C), 5th fret (D)
- D: 2nd fret (E), 4th fret (F#), 5th fret (G)
- G: 2nd fret (A), 4th fret (B), 5th fret (C)
- B: 1st fret (C), 3rd fret (D), 5th fret (E)
- High E: 1st fret (F), 3rd fret (G)

### Pattern 2 (5th Position)
- Standard CAGED pattern starting at 5th fret
- Most versatile for rock and pop applications

### Pattern 3 (7th Position)
- Higher register pattern
- Excellent for lead guitar and melodic playing

## Harmonic Applications
### Diatonic Chords (C Major Example)
- **I:** C (C - E - G) - Major tonic
- **ii:** Dm (D - F - A) - Minor supertonic
- **iii:** Em (E - G - B) - Minor mediant
- **IV:** F (F - A - C) - Major subdominant
- **V:** G (G - B - D) - Major dominant
- **vi:** Am (A - C - E) - Minor submediant
- **vii¬∞:** Bdim (B - D - F) - Diminished leading tone

### Common Progressions
1. **I - V - vi - IV** (C - G - Am - F) - Most popular progression in Western music
2. **I - vi - IV - V** (C - Am - F - G) - Classic doo-wop progression
3. **I - IV - V - I** (C - F - G - C) - Traditional cadence
4. **vi - IV - I - V** (Am - F - C - G) - Emotional progression

## Genre Applications
### Classical Music
- Foundation of Western classical harmony
- Used in virtually all major key compositions
- Essential for understanding classical form and structure

### Popular Music Genres
- **Pop:** Most pop songs use major scales and progressions
- **Rock:** Major key rock anthems and uplifting songs
- **Country:** Bright, storytelling songs often in major keys
- **Folk:** Traditional folk songs frequently use major scales
- **Jazz:** Major jazz standards and swing tunes

## Famous Songs Using Major Scale
1. **"Let It Be" - The Beatles** (C major)
2. **"Sweet Caroline" - Neil Diamond** (C major)
3. **"Don't Stop Believin'" - Journey** (E major)
4. **"Imagine" - John Lennon** (C major)
5. **"Hey Jude" - The Beatles** (F major)

## Practice Techniques
### Technical Exercises
1. **Scale runs:** Ascending and descending patterns
2. **Interval exercises:** 3rds, 4ths, 5ths through the scale
3. **Sequence patterns:** 1-2-3, 2-3-4, 3-4-5, etc.
4. **Chord arpeggios:** Playing the diatonic chords as arpeggios

### Musical Applications
1. **Improvisation:** Using the scale over major chord progressions
2. **Composition:** Writing melodies and harmonies
3. **Modal exploration:** Understanding how other modes relate
4. **Modulation:** Moving between different major keys

## Relationship to Other Scales
- **Relative Minor:** Same notes, different tonal center (Am = C major)
- **Parallel Minor:** Same root, different intervals (C minor vs C major)
- **Church Modes:** All modes derive from the major scale
- **Pentatonic Scales:** Major pentatonic uses 5 notes from major scale
- **Blues Scale:** Adds blue notes to the major pentatonic framework

## Educational Importance
- **First Scale Learned:** Usually the first scale taught to students
- **Theoretical Foundation:** Basis for understanding all music theory
- **Reference Point:** Other scales defined in relation to major scale
- **Harmonic Understanding:** Essential for chord construction and progression

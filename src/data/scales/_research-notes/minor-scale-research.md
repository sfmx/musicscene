## Basic Information
- **Scale Name:** Natural Minor Scale
- **Scale Type:** Heptatonic (7-note scale)
- **Mode:** Aeolian mode of the major scale
- **Interval Pattern:** W-H-W-W-H-W-W (Whole-Half-Whole-Whole-Half-Whole-Whole)
- **Character:** Dark, emotional, contemplative, melancholic

## Technical Details (VERIFIED)
- **Intervals from Root:** 1 - 2 - ‚ô≠3 - 4 - 5 - ‚ô≠6 - ‚ô≠7 - 8
- **Scale Degrees:** Root, Major 2nd, Minor 3rd, Perfect 4th, Perfect 5th, Minor 6th, Minor 7th, Octave
- **Relative Major:** Located a minor 3rd (3 semitones) above the minor root
- **Parallel Major:** Same root note but with raised 3rd, 6th, and 7th degrees

## Key Examples and Applications
- **A Minor (No Sharps/Flats):** A - B - C - D - E - F - G - A
- **E Minor (1 Sharp):** E - F# - G - A - B - C - D - E
- **D Minor (1 Flat):** D - E - F - G - A - Bb - C - D
- **G Minor (2 Flats):** G - A - Bb - C - D - Eb - F - G

## Guitar Fretboard Patterns
### Pattern 1 (Open Position - A Minor)
- Low E: 5th fret (A), 7th fret (B)
- A: Open (A), 2nd fret (B), 3rd fret (C)
- D: Open (D), 2nd fret (E), 3rd fret (F)
- G: Open (G), 2nd fret (A)
- B: 1st fret (C), 3rd fret (D)
- High E: Open (E), 1st fret (F), 3rd fret (G)

### Pattern 2 (5th Position)
- Standard CAGED pattern starting at 5th fret
- Commonly used for rock and metal applications

### Pattern 3 (7th Position)
- Higher register pattern
- Useful for lead guitar work and solos

## Harmonic Applications
### Diatonic Chords (A Minor Example)
- **i:** Am (A - C - E) - Minor tonic
- **ii¬∞:** Bdim (B - D - F) - Diminished supertonic
- **III:** C (C - E - G) - Major mediant
- **iv:** Dm (D - F - A) - Minor subdominant
- **v:** Em (E - G - B) - Minor dominant (can be raised to E7)
- **VI:** F (F - A - C) - Major submediant
- **VII:** G (G - B - D) - Major subtonic

### Common Progressions
1. **i - VI - VII - i** (Am - F - G - Am) - Classic minor progression
2. **i - iv - V - i** (Am - Dm - E7 - Am) - Harmonic minor influence with raised 7th
3. **i - VII - VI - VII** (Am - G - F - G) - Rock/pop progression
4. **i - v - iv - i** (Am - Em - Dm - Am) - Pure natural minor

## Genre Applications
### Classical Music
- Fundamental scale for minor key compositions
- Used by Bach, Mozart, Chopin, and other classical masters
- Essential for understanding baroque and romantic period music

### Popular Music Genres
- **Blues:** Foundation for minor blues progressions
- **Rock/Metal:** Essential for creating dark, heavy sounds
- **Folk:** Traditional folk songs often use natural minor
- **Jazz:** Used in minor jazz standards and ballads
- **Country:** Minor country songs and ballads

## Famous Songs Using Natural Minor
1. **"Stairway to Heaven" - Led Zeppelin** (A minor sections)
2. **"House of the Rising Sun" - The Animals** (A minor)
3. **"Mad World" - Gary Jules/Tears for Fears** (E minor)
4. **"Losing Religion" - R.E.M.** (A minor)
5. **"Scarred" - Papa Roach** (D minor)

## Practice Techniques
### Technical Exercises
1. **Scale runs:** Ascending and descending patterns
2. **Interval exercises:** 3rds, 4ths, 5ths through the scale
3. **Sequence patterns:** 1-2-3, 2-3-4, 3-4-5, etc.
4. **Chord arpeggios:** Playing the diatonic chords as arpeggios

### Musical Applications
1. **Improvisation:** Using the scale over minor chord progressions
2. **Composition:** Writing melodies and harmonies
3. **Modal interchange:** Borrowing from parallel major
4. **Modulation:** Moving between relative major and minor

## Relationship to Other Scales
- **Relative Major:** Same notes, different tonal center (C major = A minor)
- **Parallel Major:** Same root, different intervals (A major vs A minor)
- **Harmonic Minor:** Raised 7th degree creates leading tone
- **Melodic Minor:** Raised 6th and 7th ascending, natural descending
- **Dorian Mode:** Natural minor with raised 6th degree
- **Phrygian Mode:** Natural minor with lowered 2nd degree

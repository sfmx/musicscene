# Research Notes Directory

## Purpose
This direct### Quality Standards
- Tablature must be verified across at least 3 different QUALITY tab sources
- Prioritize Guitar World → Songsterr → TabsGuru → 911Tabs over Ultimate Guitar
- Use Ultimate Guitar only as fallback with strict verification requirements
- All technical claims must be verified by at least 2 sources
- Equipment recommendations must be historically accurate
- Any conflicts between sources must be documented
- Final decisions must be justified in fact-check notes
- Priority given to official > professional > community sourcesontains comprehensive research summaries for each song analysis page, ensuring accuracy and providing source documentation for all technical and historical information.

## Research Requirements

### Multi-Source Verification
Every song must be researched using multiple authoritative sources:

**Historical/Theoretical Sources:**
1. **Wikipedia** - Historical context, album info, chart performance
2. **AllMusic** - Professional music analysis, genre classification
3. **Songfacts** - Songwriting details, recording information
4. **Official Sources** - Band interviews, documentaries, liner notes

**Technical/Tablature Sources (Priority Order):**
1. **Guitar World/Official** - Magazine tabs and artist-verified transcriptions (PRIMARY)
2. **Songsterr** - Interactive tabs with timing and playback (PREFERRED)
3. **TabsGuru** - Professional transcriptions and complex arrangements (RECOMMENDED)
4. **911Tabs** - Tab aggregation and cross-referencing (USEFUL)
5. **Ultimate Guitar** - Community tabs (FALLBACK ONLY - require 4+ stars, 100+ votes, cross-verify)

**Source Quality Standards:**
- **Tier 1**: Official sources (Guitar World, artist-verified) - Always use when available
- **Tier 2**: Professional sources (Songsterr, TabsGuru) - Primary verification
- **Tier 3**: Aggregation sources (911Tabs) - Cross-reference tool
- **Tier 4**: Community sources (Ultimate Guitar) - Use only when others unavailable

**Ultimate Guitar Usage Rules:**
- Use ONLY as last resort when higher-tier sources unavailable
- REQUIRE 4+ star rating AND 100+ votes minimum
- MUST cross-verify with at least 2 other sources
- NEVER use as sole source for critical details
- Document clearly when used as fallback

### Critical Details to Verify
- **Tuning**: Never assume standard tuning
- **Key Signature**: Verify actual recorded key
- **Tempo**: Confirm with metronome analysis
- **Equipment**: Document specific gear used in recording
- **Historical Context**: Recording dates, locations, personnel
